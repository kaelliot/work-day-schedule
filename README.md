# work-day-schedule

## How it works
* Calendar is of a normal 9am - 5pm workday.
* Each hour has it's own block and is color coded whether it's past, present or upcoming.
* Each time block has an input field and 'save' buttons.
* Appointments can be entered to a specific hour inline.
* This is built with Bootstrap, JQuery and Moment.js.
